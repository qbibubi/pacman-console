# UPDATE 2024

> I have uploaded this repository just now because I managed to dig it out from my past projects from trade school. This is one of my first bigger projects which was part of a C++ course. Code in this repository has been written by me in year 2019/2020-ish and won't be edited. If I manage to find a wxWidgets version of this repository I will upload it to GitHub too. Both of the repositories will remain as public archives as a reminder for myself.

# PacManVisualStudio
Pacman made in C++ for a school project. Not finished yet but I'm working on it.

Project won't be finished in anytime soon since I'm working on wxWidget version of this project.

# How to run
To run the code you will need Visual Studio 2019. Then run the PacManVisualStudio.vcxproj file.
